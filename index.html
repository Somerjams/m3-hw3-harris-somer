</head> About Robyn Rihanna Fenty
<body>  Rihanna was born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in St. Michael Parish on the Caribbean Island of Barbados. She is the oldest of three children to parents, Monica, and Ronald Fenty.  Rihanna signed with Def Jam Records at age 16 and in 2005 released her first album Music of the Sun, which sold more than two million copies worldwide. 

    After being discovered by music producer Evan Rodgers, he visited the island with his Barbadian wife. She moved to Connecticut to live with Rodgers and his wife, to cut a four-song demo. “When I left Barbados, I didn’t look back”, said Rihanna. I wanted to do what I had to do, even if it meant moving to America”. She went on to release more albums and an array of hit songs, including "Unfaithful," "Umbrella," "Disturbia," "Take a Bow," "Diamonds" and "We Found Love." 
    
    Rihanna is also known for her fashion, “Rihanna’s status as a fashion icon may be the one that best encapsulates the power and reach of her cultural influence” (Lang, 2023). Today, Rihanna has become a Billionaire with a net worth of 1.4 billion in 2023, with the value of Fenty Beauty which owns 50%. Her lingerie company, Savage x Fenty, is worth $270 million according to Forbes. Now, she can add being a mom to the list of awards. Rihanna gave birth to her son, RZA in May of 2022 and recently brought another little boy into the world, named Riot in August 2023. 
    
    Rihanna has impacted my life so much as a girl growing up. She has taught me that it's okay to be different and that fitting in is not always a good thing. Rihanna will forever be a trendsetter in her right. In music, business and fashion just know that Bad Gal RiRi did it First!
